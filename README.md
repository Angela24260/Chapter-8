# Chapter-8:Creating an App’s Navigation
### What I Learned:
This chapter focused on implementing navigation in a Flutter app, an essential skill for creating multi-page applications. I learned how Flutter's Navigator widget controls the app's stack of screens (or routes), allowing users to move between different pages. I explored how to push and pop routes onto the navigation stack using Navigator.push() and Navigator.pop(), which enables screen transitions.

The chapter also introduced the concept of named routes and anonymous routes. Named routes are predefined routes with unique names, making it easier to manage navigation in larger apps. I learned how to define named routes in the MaterialApp widget and navigate to them using Navigator.pushNamed(). On the other hand, anonymous routes are typically used for more temporary navigation, where a route is defined inline and doesn't need a name. I learned when to use each method depending on the complexity of the app and the need for flexibility in the navigation flow.

### Achievement:
My key achievement for this chapter was building a multi-page app with seamless navigation. I created an app that allowed users to move between different screens, such as a home page, a details page, and a settings page. I implemented both named and anonymous routes for different use cases within the app and passed data between the pages to enhance the app’s interactivity. This project gave me hands-on experience with managing app navigation and structuring an app with multiple screens.
